Heart Disease Diagnosis using Explainable AI (XAI)
Independent Machine Learning Project | Nov. 2025
•	Built an interpretable Random Forest classifier to predict heart disease risk, demonstrating high clinical alignment and transparency.
•	Utilized SHAP values, Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) and Feature Importance analysis to move the model beyond a 'black box,' significantly enhancing trustworthiness among clinicians.
•	Bridged AI prediction with medical reasoning by identifying ST depression, ECG slope, and number of major vessels as the strongest, most influential risk predictors.
•	Preprocessed and encoded mixed-type healthcare data to improve model consistency and interpretability, facilitating communication with domain experts.
•	Communicated model insights with clear visuals and domain explanations to highlight explainable healthcare AI applications.
